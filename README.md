# ecommerce-web-site(Trendyol)


I designed an interface using html css js. I used Bootstrap as the CSS framework. I used Python's Flask framework for the backend and it also includes SQL. In addition, the purpose of the project is to create an e-commerce interface and extract product information from the data and display it to the user. However, there is a detail page for each product and the products appear when the product information is entered.
